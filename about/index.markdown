The Imperial College Dramatic Society is one of two major theatrical arts
societies at Imperial College London, with the other being the 
[Musical Theatre Society](http://mtsoc.co.uk). Founded in 1907, around 
the time of the founding of the College, we have existed for over a
hundred years and even predate Imperial College Union.

Each year we aim to put on three major plays, as well as several smaller fringe productions, acting and technical workshops, and providing technical services to other Clubs and Societies of the Union. Unusually amongst University drama societies, we maintain a full complement of theatrical equipment, technicians, designers, carpenters, riggers, and stage and production managers, in addition to hosting a large community of actors. This gives us a unique advantage to our productions: from the initial planning stages, to the design and get-in, all the way through to the show run, everyone is working alongside each other and interacting closely to produce truly remarkable results.
