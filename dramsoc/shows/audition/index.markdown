Whether you have professional experience, have acted in every school play you've ever had the chance to, have never gone near a stage in your life or sit comfortably anywhere in between, acting in DramSoc is for you! All you need is a touch of enthusiasm and the time to go ahead and give it a go!




There are opportunities to get involved at every level. Perhaps you'd like to take your first ever step on stage, or maybe you fancy yourself as a producer or director. Whatever you want to do, we're the society with the opportunities and the know-how.




If you want to know more or ask any questions, drop the [Acting Director](mailto:acting@dramsoc.org) an e-mail.
