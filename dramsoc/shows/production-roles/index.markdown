## _Red _- Workshop


Production week: POSTPONED

Uni is complicated. Degrees, relationships, the ever-approaching threat of having to grow up, be an adult, and be bored and unfulfilled.  James is only making it more complicated for himself by trying to stage a play with the world’s most dysfunctional cast. Jennifer just wants to make it through this show - through her degree - without it all going tits up. Scarlett just wants to have fun. With the world’s most dysfunctional cast thrown in the mix, life just got much harder for everyone. As opening night inches closer, emotions ride high and a happy ending looks even further away...

Director: Jack Steadman

This show is looking for production team members in the following departments:
Producer
Assistant Director
Stage Management
Sound
Lighting

This is a tiny, tiny show for us - it's a workshop, so things going wrong is expected (if not entirely encouraged). It's really minimal work and commitment - for one week only, with no prep time needed beforehand for any role except the producer & director. If you want to get a sense of how a show works in miniature, this is perfect.

## _Ghosts_ - Studio


Production week: 4-6 November

Helene Alving has spent her life suspended in an emotional void after the death of her cruel but outwardly charming husband. She is determined to escape the ghosts of her past by telling her son, Oswald, the truth about his father. But on his return from his life as a painter in France, Oswald reveals how he has already inherited the legacy of Alving's dissolute life.

Director: Daisy Rogers-Simmonds
Producer: Omar Hussein

This show is looking for crew in the following departments:
Assistant Producer
Stage Management
Set
Props
Costumes
Lighting
Sound

Not as small as the workshop (this is a 'proper' production), but not as large as the main show at the end of term, this is ideal if you want to stretch your wings. Never produced before? Studio show is the perfect place to start. Never directed? Studio. Never designed a set? Studio. You name it, a studio show lets you try and learn in a lower-pressure, smaller-scale environment.

For those who are more familiar with productions, a studio show brings different challenges and rewards - by taking the show out of the UCH, the game is completely changed, and the possibilities for just how you handle the show really open up.

Feel like trying something a bit different from the usual? [You know you want to](mailto:omar@dramsoc.org).


## _Beowulf _- Main


Production week: 7-10 December

Beowulf is a hero of the Geatish people (from Scandinavia). On hearing that the king of the Geat’s allies, Hrothgar is beset by an evil monster named Grendel, he travels to Denmark to slay it.

Producer: Daniel Clay
Director: Oscar Gill

This show is looking for crew in the following departments:
Stage Management
Set
Props
Costumes
Hair & Make-up
Lighting
Sound
Special Effects

I can't even with this show. It's going to be huge - current plans are to turn the UCH into a mead hall, and we've got monsters a-plenty to be creating. If you've ever wanted to make a dragon fly (and fight) on stage, now's your chance. [Get your #ambitious on by emailing Dan](mailto:daniel.clay@dramsoc.org).

We'll keep updating this page as things happen - if you've got any questions, email Jack, the President, at [president@dramsoc.org](mailto:president@dramsoc.org).
