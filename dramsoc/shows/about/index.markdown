DramSoc puts on at least one full-length play in our theatre, the Union Concert Hall, per term, as well as a number of other plays in different venues around the College and further afield. Usually our main shows have casts of between 15 and 20 people and we welcome auditions from anyone with any amount of experience, so if you're thinking of getting involved, keep an eye out for audition posters and notices on our website, [social media](https://facebook.com/dramsoc), and our [mailing lists](http://dramsoc.org/wordpress/talk/) at the start and end of every term.

If you want to see a play put on by DramSoc, come along to our termly play proposals meetings. More information can be found on our [Proposals page](https://www.dramsoc.org/shows/propose/)!
