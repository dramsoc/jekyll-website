DramSoc hosts regular acting workshops in a variety of disciplines, run by theatre professionals and experienced actors. In the past, we've run workshops on improvisation, Shakespeare, stage combat, and have even put together small projects like radio plays and pieces for Imperial's ArtsFest. Workshops are usually free for DramSoc members.




**There are no Acting Workshops this term (Summer 2016).**
