Technical services by DramSoc[/caption]


DramSoc provides a wide range of technical services; from plays to musicals, talent shows to outdoor music festival stages, variety shows to the annual Summer Ball, we do it all. We have a large and dedicated crew, and hire out professional lighting and sound equipment, props and set from our extensive stores. In addition, we offer comprehensive production management, consultancy and design services.







Our experience in production management and design ranges from the large-scale annual Summer Ball, including the lighting and sound in the Great Hall and the Queen's Tower Rooms and all the set and design features, down to small societal events in Metric. As such we believe that you will find our help and advice invaluable whilst planning your event, regardless of its size or complexity.




Even if you do not use DramSoc's services, we will be more than happy to advise and assist in getting alternative quotes. However, we are quite confident that we care more about the success of your event than a hire company would, and we can deliver more for your money, too. In any case, please try to get in contact with us as early as possible, as the more time we have, the better we can help you.




Please contact the [DramSoc Technical Director](mailto:techdir@dramsoc.org) for all enquiries related to technical services.
