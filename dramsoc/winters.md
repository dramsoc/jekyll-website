# Tropical Winters™


For Tropical Winters™ mix:



 	
  * Two parts Gin

 	
  * One part Peach Schnapps

 	
  * Three parts Orange Juice

 	
  * Three parts Pineapple Juice


And then top off with lemonade (usually six parts). Tropical Winters™ can be conveniently be made up to one pint by taking one part equal to 25ml.

As of 9th December 2016, one pint of Tropical Winters™ will set you back the handsome sum of £8.90 at the ICU Bar.


# Arctic Winters


Top one pint of Tropical Winters™ with whipped cream. This concoction is significantly lower quality than straight Tropical Winters™.


# Winters Royale


Half Tropical Winters™, half Champagne. For when you need to burn through the bar tab faster than you can say 'What Wall?'


# Nuclear Winters


One third Peach Schnapps, two thirds Gin, drunk as a bomb with Red Bull. Don't do it.
