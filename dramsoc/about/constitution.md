The Constitution governs DramSoc within Imperial College Union and works in tandem with the Clubs, Societies and Projects Policy, ICU Bye-Laws, and the Arts and Entertainments Management Group Policies to provide a complete set of rules for the society to operate within.




The current version of the Constitution was passed by the Society at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 3rd November 2015, and was approved by the Arts and Entertainments Board of Imperial College Union at their meeting on 15th December 2015. It can be viewed below, or downloaded in PDF format.
