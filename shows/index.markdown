### What our clients say


Emoji: the untold story of the little people in your phone. Join us at Edinburgh Fringe as we take a tongue-in-cheek look at fame, faith and communication.

Meet Kyle’s phone. Inside it, like every mobile, a hidden emoji-world exists. Emojis live with one ultimate goal: to become one of the ‘frequently used’. Brian the brown shoe emoji is a deadbeat. In one night, Brian is used 27 times, skyrocketing him to fame. How will he cope? Will the poo emoji like him? Or will he end up back in the pool of anonymous emojis, never to be used again? Join us, as we delve into the fame-obsessed universe of emojis. You’ll laugh with tears of joy! You’ll cry two parallel streams of tears! You’ll… Aubergine!

This is the second time Imperial College London’s Dramatic Society have performed at Fringe. The company developed the script using improvisation-based processes to deliver a funny, irreverent story about celebrity culture, told through the eyes of Emojis.

2016fringeAcclaimed as a modern dramatic masterpiece, Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead is the fabulously inventive tale of Hamlet as told from the worm’s-eve view of the bewildered Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters in Shakespeare’s play. In Tom Stoppard’s best-known work, this Shakespearean Laurel and Hardy finally get a chance to take the lead role, but do so in a world where echoes of Waiting for Godot resound, where reality and illusion intermix, and where fate leads our two heroes to a tragic but inevitable end.

**__Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead__ will be performed from 20th – 22nd June 2016 in the Union Concert Hall**

2015autumnKaturian, a writer of short stories which often depict violence against children, has been arrested by two detectives, Ariel and Tupolski, because some of his stories resemble recent child murders.

2015extra1Prepare to be transported in space and time to the year 1956, middle-of-no-where-America, at the Annual Quiche Breakfast Meeting of the Susan B. Anthony Society for the Sisters of Gertrude Stein! You can expect quiche (of course), sexual tension (we are ‘widows’, after all), and a looming threat of a nuclear attack… What could possibly go wrong?

_**Five Lesbians Eating a Quiche **_**ran in the Union Concert Hall on 14th, 16th and 17th October 2015.**

2015freshersAfter rehearsing for months, one actor still has a bit of trouble remembering the production, let alone the lines… Going off-script and off-story, how will the cast keep up with a show that just keeps getting weirder?

_**Forget About It**_** was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, at Paradise in the Vault.**

2015fringe‘The Last Days Of Judas Iscariot’ tells the story of a ballsy (dead) lawyer, Fabiana Aziza Cunningham, seeking to set the record straight about the Bible’s most notorious (dead) sinner, one Judas Iscariot. In this rip-roaring, no-holds-barred, seriocomically imagined court room drama, (dead) witnesses from Sigmund Freud to Satan himself are called forth to give evidence in the case “God and the Kingdom of Heaven and Earth versus Judas Iscariot” to determine the accused’s eternal fate: damnation or salvation.

Written by Stephen Adly Guirgis, ‘The Last Days of Judas Iscariot’ is a truly modern play, mixing a stirring sense of Catholic existential pain and a wonderment at the paradoxes of faith with the lowdown street talk and in-your-face humour that characterises downtown New York.

_**The Last Days of Judas Iscariot**_** was performed from 23rd-25th June 2015 on the Queen’s Lawn, Imperial College.**

2015summerShakespeare’s The Tempest tells the story of Prospero, a duke of great powers who is betrayed by his brother and exiled on an island with his infant daughter. It is a story of revenge and forgiveness, of mighty magic and its consequences, of passionate lovers, scheming nobles and boisterous drunks. This being a DramSoc production, it is also a story of miraculous engineering, complete with fireworks, mechanical harpies and a jazz band from the Roaring Twenties.

_**The Tempest**_** was performed from 4th-7th March 2015 in the Union Concert Hall.**

2015springIt’s 1987 and a group of residents of a poor run-down Lancashire town are getting ready to go out for a drink. Come and visit ROAD and let Scullery show you round and introduce to its inhabitants. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry and you’ll have a bloody good time in our production of Jim Cartwright’s classic play with a message about society that’s every bit as relevant today as it was when it was written during Thatcher’s Britain of the 80s.

_**Road**_** opened on 10/12/14 and ran daily until 13/12/14 in the Union Concert Hall**

2014autumnA play written by [David Mamet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet) that examines the sex lives of two men and two women in the 1970s. The play is filled with profanity and regional [jargon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon) that reflects the working-class language of [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago). The characters’ relationships become hindered by the caustic nature of their words, as much of the dialogue includes insults and arguments. The play presents “intimate relationships [as] minefields of buried fears and misunderstandings”.

_**Sexual Perversity in Chicago**_ **was performed on October 15th, 17th, 18th and 19th 2014 in the Union Concert Hall.**

2014freshersThe Virtuous Burglar is a farce by Nobel prize winning playwright Dario Fo (Accidental Death of an Anarchist). The cast is a burglar, the burglar’s wife, a man, the man’s lover, the man’s wife and the man’s wife’s lover. You don’t need to know much more than that, really.

A wife nagged burglar is caught red-handed by a loved-up cuckolded proprietor, so the burglar hides in a grandfather clock. Then, somebody else’s wife arrives with her lover, another cuckold, so he, too, has to hide inside the grandfather clock. From there, events get ridiculous.

_**The Virtuous Burglar **_**was performed on 29th and 30th July 2014 in Metric, and then at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2014.**

2014fringeSidley Park in 1809. Lady Thomasina Coverly attempts to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, discovering her own theory of chaos in the process, while her tutor Septimus Hodge dices with death by dueling over a perpendicular poke in a gazebo with the village noticeboard.

200 years later, Hannah Jarvis the bestselling author is investigating the hermit of Sidley Park – present in the time of Thomasina and Septimus – while English professor Bernard Nightingale searches for his own proof that Lord Byron fought and won a duel – the very same duel Septimus is trying to avoid.

Bound by the same geography, but separated by two centuries, past and present interact and collide in Stoppard’s comically tragic, tragically comic play on life, death, sex and the universe.

_**Arcadia**_** was performed from the 17th to the 19th of June 2014 on the Queen’s Lawn, Imperial College London.**

2014summerOn St. George’s Day, the morning of the local county fair, Johnny “Rooster” Byron, local waster and modern day Pied Piper, welcomes you to his alcoholic bucolic frolic at his trailer in the Wiltshire woods. On the set list are whizz, wangers, and tasty beats; a motley band of characters are after his gypsy blood. The council officials want to serve him an eviction notice, his son wants to be taken to the fair, a father wants to give him a serious kicking, and a beloved cohort of spongers want his ample supply of drugs and alcohol.

A state-of-the-nation comedy on contemporary rural life, ‘Jerusalem’ gives the proverbial finger to England’s green and pleasant land.

_**Jerusalem**_** opened on the 12th March 2014 and ran daily until 15th March in the Union Concert Hall.**

2014springA small provincial town is thrown into chaos when a rumour spreads that a high ranking government official is staying at the local inn; he doesn’t eat, he doesn’t talk to anyone, he never leaves his room. His secretive behaviour is taken to mean that he’s making meticulous reports on the town’s institutions.

Actually, he just can’t pay his bills. The landlord threatens to have him thrown in jail, so when the mayor goes to visit to pay his respects, the good-for-nothing vagabond assumes the worst…

This is a famous farce by Nikolai Gogol, lampooning the vain and self-seeking behaviour of corrupt officials, and when first shown caused the Tsarist government to ban the play and send its author into exile.

_**The Government Inspector **_**was performed from the 4th – 7th December 2013 in the Union Concert Hall.**
