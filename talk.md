Joining our mailing lists is the best way to keep up to date with society news, and find out about society events. Read the descriptions below to help you decide which lists to join.




**DramSoc Talk**











This is the main society mailing list. All society members should be on this list. If you want information about our plays and society events, then this is the list to join.




Traffic is minimal; a weekly newsletter and information about our plays are the only things that go to this list.

**Actor Talk**













This list is for conversation between DramSoc's community of actors, and those interested in acting. It will be the primary means of contact for workshops and members will be the first to know about auditions for upcoming plays.

**Crew Talk**













This list is for crew members, and is the main way we distribute crew information, event and show dates, crew requests andÂ crew calls. All crew members should be on this list!




Unless explicitly stated otherwise, anyone can show up for any call that interests them, regardless of skill level or prior experience; we find the best way to learn is to join our experienced crew and learn from them!
